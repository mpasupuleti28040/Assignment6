# README for Assignment 6

This repository includes the implementation of **Selection Algorithms** and **Elementary Data Structures**. Below are the steps to run the code, along with a summary of the algorithms and data structures covered in this assignment.

## Part 1: Selection Algorithms

### Description
In Part 1, we implemented two important algorithms for selecting the \(k^{th}\) smallest element in an array:
1. **Median of Medians Algorithm**: A deterministic algorithm ensuring worst-case linear time complexity (O(n)) for selecting the median.
2. **Quickselect Algorithm**: A randomized algorithm that provides expected linear time complexity in average cases but can degrade to O(nÂ²) in the worst case.

### Files
- **Ass 6 Part 1.py**: This script contains the implementation of both the **deterministic** and **randomized** selection algorithms. It also includes a benchmarking function to compare the runtime performance of both algorithms on various input arrays.

### How to Run
1. Install Python 3.
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Navigate to the directory in your terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the file `Ass 6 Part 1.py` by using the following command:
    ```bash
    python Ass 6 Part 1.py
    ```

### Summary of Findings
- **Quickselect** is faster on average but may suffer from poor performance in worst-case scenarios (reverse-sorted arrays).
- **Median of Medians** guarantees worst-case linear time, making it more reliable in situations where worst-case performance matters.

The benchmarking results demonstrate that Quickselect generally performs better with random inputs, while Median of Medians shows consistent performance across all input types.

## Part 2: Elementary Data Structures

### Description
Part 2 focuses on implementing and analyzing the performance of basic data structures, including:
- **Array and Matrices**: Arrays for sequential data storage and matrices for two-dimensional data handling.
- **Stacks**: A LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) data structure.
- **Queues**: A FIFO (First-In-First-Out) data structure.
- **Linked Lists**: Singly linked lists for dynamic memory management.
- **Rooted Trees**: Trees for representing hierarchical data.

### Files
- **Ass 6 Part 2.py**: This script contains the implementation of all the data structures listed above, along with examples demonstrating their use.

### How to Run
1. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Navigate to the directory in your terminal.
4. Execute the `Ass 6 Part 2.py` file using this command:
    ```bash
    python Ass 6 Part 2.py
    ```

### Summary of Findings
- **Arrays** provide O(1) time complexity for access but are inefficient for insertions and deletions (O(n) in the worst case).
- **Stacks and Queues** offer efficient O(1) time complexity for insertions and deletions due to their LIFO and FIFO nature.
- **Linked Lists** are useful for dynamic memory allocation, allowing O(1) insertions and deletions but suffering from O(n) time for access.
- **Rooted Trees** are essential for representing hierarchical data and are commonly used in algorithms like search trees, file systems, and decision-making processes.

Each data structure has its own set of trade-offs, and choosing the right one depends on the specific use case.
